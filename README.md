# Scrabble-Full-Game

This script is my try to create fully playable Scrabble game. Although I know CLI is not the best framework to create games, I find this project great way to develop my coding skills. Later, when I learn appropriate app building skills, I plan to create a proper client to play it. For now it's only possible to play it with Python installed.

All instructions how to play will be shown after opening the game in CLI.
