# Scrabble-Full-Game

This script is my try to create fully playable Scrabble game. Although I know CLI is not the best framework to create games, I find this project great way to develop my coding skills. Later, when I learn appropriate app building skills, I plan to create a proper client to play it. For now it's only possible to play it with Python installed.

To play run the code from scrab.py file.

All instructions how to play will be shown after opening the game in CLI.

Since the game is still under development, for now it only allows to put words as a player. Soon I will add AI with two difficulty levels.
