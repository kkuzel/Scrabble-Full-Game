# Scrabble-Full-Game

This script is my try to create fully playable Scrabble game. Although I know CLI is not the most convinient framework to create games, I find this project great way to develop my coding skills. Later, when I learn appropriate app building skills, I plan to create a proper client to play it. For now it's only possible to play it with Python installed.

Right now I'm working on releasing full version where it's possible to play against program.

To see the version where program will put the best possible words on board until letterbag is empty, run the code from s.py file.

To play the version where you can put words by yourself, run the code from scrab.py file.

All instructions how to play will be shown after opening the game in CLI.

Since the game is still under development, for now it only allows to put words as a player. Soon I will add AI with two difficulty levels.
